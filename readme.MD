# The Book of Profound Darkness
This is a module of custom content that I've created for the FoundryVTT implementation of the Pathfinder 2nd Edition system. This content has been developed entirely by me for my own home games. I have this here mainly as a way to make it easily portable for my own games and to make it available to others.
